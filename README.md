## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Caraveo/ZiaCoin-Network.git
cd ZiaCoin-Network/chain
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Create your first wallet:
```bash
python3 wallet.py createrecord "MyWallet" "your-secure-passphrase"
```

### Basic Usage

1. **Start a Node**
```bash
# Start a node with default configuration
python3 node.py

# Start a node with custom port
python3 node.py --port 8334

# Start a node with specific bootstrap nodes
python3 node.py --bootstrap-nodes "127.0.0.1:8333,127.0.0.1:8334"
```

2. **Create a Wallet**
```bash
python3 wallet.py createrecord "WalletName" "passphrase"
```

3. **Load an Existing Wallet**
```bash
python3 wallet.py load "wallet-address" "passphrase"
```

4. **Recover Wallet from Mnemonic**
```bash
python3 wallet.py recover "your-mnemonic-phrase" "passphrase"
```

5. **Start Mining**
```bash
python3 miner.py
```

6. **Run the API Server**
```bash
python3 app.py
```

## üîß Configuration

Create a `chain.config` file in the root directory with your settings:

```json
{
    "network": {
        "port": 8333,
        "bootstrap_nodes": []
    },
    "mining": {
        "difficulty": 4,
        "reward": 50
    },
    "wallet": {
        "storage_path": "wallets/"
    }
}
```

## üìö API Endpoints

- `POST /wallet/new` - Create a new wallet
- `POST /transaction/new` - Create a new transaction
- `POST /mine` - Mine a new block
- `GET /chain` - Get the full blockchain
- `GET /validate` - Validate the blockchain

## üîí Security

- All private keys are encrypted using AES-GCM
- Transactions are signed using ECDSA
- Automatic code synchronization ensures you're running the latest secure version
- Regular security audits and updates
