# Block Time Update: 60 Seconds → 1 Hour

## 🕐 Block Time Configuration Change

The ZiaCoin Network block time has been updated from **60 seconds** to **1 hour (3600 seconds)**.

## 📊 Updated Configuration

### **New Settings:**
- **Target Block Time**: 1 hour (3600 seconds)
- **Difficulty Adjustment Range**: 30 minutes - 2 hours
- **Starting Difficulty**: 4 (unchanged)
- **Mining Reward**: 50 ZIA (unchanged)

### **Files Updated:**
- `node.conf` - Updated block_time to 3600
- `node.py` - Added block_time parameter to miner initialization
- `MINING_GUIDE.md` - Updated documentation

## 🔄 Difficulty Adjustment Logic

The difficulty now adjusts based on 1-hour target:

```python
def _adjust_difficulty(self, block_time: float):
    if block_time < 1800:  # < 30 minutes
        self.current_difficulty += 1  # Increase difficulty
    elif block_time > 7200:  # > 2 hours  
        self.current_difficulty = max(1, self.current_difficulty - 1)  # Decrease difficulty
```

## 📈 Impact on Network

### **Advantages of 1-Hour Blocks:**
- ✅ **Lower Energy Consumption** - Less frequent mining
- ✅ **Reduced Network Traffic** - Fewer block broadcasts
- ✅ **Better for Low-Hash Networks** - More time to find blocks
- ✅ **Stable Transaction Processing** - Less frequent reorganizations

### **Network Growth Scenarios:**

| Network Size | Hash Rate | Block Time | Difficulty Adjustment |
|--------------|-----------|------------|----------------------|
| 1 miner | Low | ~1 hour | No change |
| 10 miners | 10x | ~6 minutes | Increase +3 |
| 100 miners | 100x | ~36 seconds | Increase +6 |
| 1000 miners | 1000x | ~3.6 seconds | Increase +9 |

## 🚀 Production Benefits

### **For Your Bootstrap Node:**
- **Less Resource Intensive** - Blocks every hour instead of every minute
- **Better Stability** - Reduced chance of orphaned blocks
- **Easier Monitoring** - Less frequent status updates needed

### **For Network Participants:**
- **Lower Hardware Requirements** - Can mine with basic equipment
- **Reduced Electricity Costs** - Less continuous mining
- **Better for Small Miners** - More time to find valid blocks

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### **Transaction Confirmation:**
- **1 confirmation**: ~1 hour (1 block)
- **6 confirmations**: ~6 hours (6 blocks)
- **24 confirmations**: ~24 hours (24 blocks)

### **Mining Rewards:**
- **Same reward per block**: 50 ZIA
- **Lower frequency**: 1 block per hour instead of 1 per minute
- **Same total rewards**: Over time, rewards remain the same

## 🔧 Restart Required

After this change, you need to restart your node:

```bash
# Stop current node (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart
./start_bootstrap.sh
```

## 📋 Verification

Check the new block time is active:

```bash
# Check node status
curl http://localhost:9999/status

# Monitor mining (will show longer intervals)
python3 start_mining.py --status
```
